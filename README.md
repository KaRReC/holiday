# holiday

One page website, where I concentrated in JavaScript and jQuery a little bit less in Html and Css. 

Website contains:

1. JS function that shows current time and date.
2. JS for side navigation menu.
3. Photos slider made in JS & jQuery.
4. jQuery function that filters (search) table after entering one letter.
5. Weather widget with API connetion, which provides JSON object. I've used it to get temperature, weather description etc.
  Widget have also geolocation funciton and 4 others with with defined parameters ( latitude, longitude ).
6. Range slider working together with <input type="number"> and function that calculates cost of taxi.
7. Function that calculates holiday trip cost after selecting customized options. Plus validation for selected options.
8. jQuery script that disable some options, when others are chosen.
9. Reset function which remove selected options.

I added order.php file, it contains script that inserts data into database.
